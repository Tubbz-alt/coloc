# CoLoC

CoLoC is a computer vision based pipeline for collaborative localization between multiple cameras. The targeted application for this software is collaborative localization for micro aerial vehicles equipped with monocular cameras, as described in the following papers:

The code is still a work in progress, with ROS integration, final refinements and testing underway.
